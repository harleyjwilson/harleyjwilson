# Hi, I'm Harley Wilson

I'm a Software Engineer at SecDim, based in Perth, Western Australia. I recently completed my Bachelor of Computing (Software Engineering) after transitioning into tech from a nine-year career as a Police Officer.

Beyond coding, I'm a husband, father, dog owner, reader, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) practitioner.
